A detailed readme highlighting thought process and architectural decisions]

Architectural Decisions - 
- I used Model-View-View-Model(MVVM) for the architectural structure

Reasons 
- The MVVM helps to me in this project to neatly separate the business and presentation logic of an app from its UI
- The Model-View-viewModel architecture comprises of the 
Model - Which is the app data used to feed the view or UI
View - Which is what you can see (i.e the design or UI)
ViewModel - is the business and presentation logic
- MVVM also made it easy for me to perform unit testing

Thought Process -
Step 1 - I tested the end point on postman
Step 2 - Created a git repository 
Step 3 - Created my project on xcode
Step 4 - Installed kingFisher
Step 5 - Created my Folder Structure
Step 6 - Designed the UI
Step 7 - Model the response of the API
Step 8 - Write a generic Url session
Step 9 - Coded the date resource and view model 
Step 10 - Implement the end point to appear on the UI
Step 10 - Implement unit testing
